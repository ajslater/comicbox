# Comicbox

A comic book archive metadata reader and writer.

## ‚ú® <a href="features">Features</a>

### üìö<a href="comicFormats">Comic Formats</a>

Comicbox reads CBZ, CBR, CBT, and optionally PDF.
Comicbox archives and writes CBZ archives and PDF metadata.

### üè∑Ô∏è <a href="metadata_formats">Metadata Formats</a>

Comicbox reads and writes:

- [ComicRack Comicinfo.xml v2.1 (draft) schema](https://anansi-project.github.io/docs/comicinfo/schemas/v2.1),
- [Comic Book Lover ComicBookInfo schema](https://code.google.com/archive/p/comicbookinfo/)
- [CoMet schema](https://github.com/wdhongtw/comet-utils).
- [PDF Metadata](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#accessing-meta-data).
- A variety of filename schemes that encode metadata.

### Usefulness

Comicbox's primary purpose is a library for use by [Codex comic reader](https://github.com/ajslater/codex/).
The API isn't well documented, but you can infer what it does pretty easily here: [comicbox.comic_archive](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/comicbox/comic_archive.py) as the primary interface.

The command line is increasingly useful and can read and write metadata recursively and extract pages.

### Limitations and Alternatives

Comicbox does _not_ use popular metadata database APIs or have a GUI!

[Comictagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) is a popular alternative. It does most of what Comicbox does but also automatically tags comics with the ComicVine API and has a desktop UI.

## üì¶ <a href="install">Installation</a>

```sh
pip install comicbox
```

Comicbox supports PDFs as an extra when installed like:

```sh
pip install comicbox[pdf]
```

### Dependencies

Comicbox generally works without any binary dependencies but requires `unrar` be on the path to convert CBR into CBZ or extract files from CBRs.

## ‚å®Ô∏è <a href="usage">Usage</a>

### Console

Type

```sh
comicbox -h
```

see the CLI help.

#### Examples

```sh
comicbox test.cbz -m "{Tags: a,b,c, story_arcs: {d:1,e:'',f:3}" -m "Publisher: SmallComics" -w cr
```

Will write those tags to comicinfo.xml in the archive.

But it's probably better to use the --print action to see what it's going to do before you actually write to the archive:

```sh
comicbox test.cbz -m "{Tags: a,b,c, story_arcs: {d:1,e:'',f:3}" -m "Publisher: SmallComics" -p
```

A recursive example:

```sh
comicbox --recurse -m "publisher: SC Comics" -w cr ./SmallComicsComics/
```

Will recursively change the publisher to "SC Comics" for every comic found in under the SmallComicsComics directory.

#### Packages

Comicbox actually installs three different packages:

- `comicbox` The main API and CLI script.
- `comicfn2dict` A separate library for parsing comic filenames into dicts it also includes a CLI script.
- `pdffile` A utility library for reading and writing PDF files with an API like Python's ZipFile

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config

comicbox accepts command line arguments but also an optional config file
and environment variables.

The variables have defaults specified in
[a default yaml](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/comicbox/config_default.yaml)

The environment variables are the variable name prefixed with `COMICBOX_`. (e.g. COMICBOX_COMICINFOXML=0)

#### Log Level

change logging level:

```sh
LOGLEVEL=ERROR comicbox -p <path>
```

## üõ† <a href="development">Development</a>

You may access most development tasks from the makefile. Run make to see documentation.

## ü§î <a href="motivation">Motivation</a>

I didn't like Comictagger's API, so I built this for myself as an educational exercise and to use as a library for
[Codex comic reader](https://github.com/ajslater/codex/).

## üìã <a href="schemas">Schemas</a>

Comicbox supports reading and writing several comic book metadata schemas.

### Filename Schema

Comicbox includes a pretty good comic archive filename parser. It can extract a number of common fields from comic archive filenames.

| Location      | Name                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Archive       | The archive filename  |
| Import/Export | comicbox-filename.txt |

### PDF Schema

The pdf metadata standard. Can be exported as an xml file or written directly to the pdf itself.

[Adobe PDF Namespace](https://developer.adobe.com/xmp/docs/XMPNamespaces/pdf/)
[Adobe PDF Standard](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/standards/pdfstandards/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf) ¬ß 14.3.3 Document Information Dictionary

PDF metadata is only read or written from and to PDF files.

| Location      | Name             |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Archive       | PDF internal     |
| Import/Export | pdf-metadata.xml |

### CoMet Schema

An old and uncommon comic metadata standard from a defunct comic book reader.

[CoMet Specification](http://www.denvog.com/comet/comet-specification/)

| Location      | Name      |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Archive       | comet.xml |
| Import/Export | comet.xml |

### ComicBookInfo Schema (Comic Book Lover)

The Comic Book Lover schema. A rare but still encountered JSON schema. It probably survives because Comictagger supports writing it.

[ComicBookInfo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/comicbookinfo/wikis/Example.wiki)

| Location      | Name                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Archive       | Zip & Rar Comments   |
| Import/Export | comic-book-info.json |

### ComicInfo Schema (Comic Rack)

The Comic Rack schema. The de facto standard of comic book metadata.
The Comic Rack reader is defunct, but the [Anansi Project](https://anansi-project.github.io/) now publishes the ComicInfo spec and has compatibly and conservatively extended it.

[Anansi ComicInfo v2.1 Spec](https://anansi-project.github.io/docs/comicinfo/schemas/v2.1)
Also, an unofficial, undocumented Mylar extension to ComicInfo.xml that encodes multiple Story Arcs and Story Arc Numbers as CSV values.

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicinfo.xml |
| Import/Export | comicinfo.xml |

### ComicTagger Schema

The most useful comic book metadata writer is [ComicTagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger). It supports the ComicVine API, is extensible to other APIs, and features a nice desktop GUI. Internally, Comictagger keeps a metadata object to work with the schemas it supports. This schema allows the import and export of that schema.

[Comictaggger genericmetadata.py](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/blob/develop/comicapi/genericmetadata.py)

This schema may only be useful to developers. The author of ComicTagger offers no promises as to the stability of this API and I am very lazy, so the chances of this drifting out of date are anyone's guess. It was included because it was easy to do.

| Location      | Name             |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Archive       | comictagger.json |
| Import/Export | comictagger.json |

### Comicbox Schema

The comicbox internal data structure which acts as a superset of the above schemas to allow interpolating.

[Comicbox JSON Schema](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/schemas/comicbox.schema.json)

#### JSON Format

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicbox.json |
| Import/Export | comicbox.json |

#### YAML Format

YAML is a superset of JSON, so the JSON schema applies here.

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicbox.yaml |
| Import/Export | comicbox.yaml |

#### CLI Format

The Comicbox CLI uses "flow style" YAML, which is an all on one line format to enter metadata on the command line.

| Location      | Name              |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Comicbox CLI  | -m --metadata     |
| Archive       | comicbox-cli.yaml |
| Import/Export | comicbox-cli.yaml |
