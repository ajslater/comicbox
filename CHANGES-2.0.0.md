# Changes 2.0.0

## Config & CLI

### New Options

#### metadata_format

Hint to the metadata parser what format API metadata will be parsed as. Config
Only.

#### stamp

Normally comicbox will only update the notes (if enabled), tagger, and
updated_at tags when performing a write or export action. This adds the stamps
anyway.

#### theme

Pygments theme to use for syntax highlighting. https://pygments.org/styles/.
'none' will stop highlighting.

### Changed Actions

### covers

Was named `cover`.

#### delete-all-tags

Was named `delete`.

## New Formats

### MetronInfo

The (MetronInfo)[https://metron-project.github.io/docs/category/metroninfo]
comic metadata format is now fully supported.

## API

### box.extract_covers()

Was named box.extract_covers_as()

### get_pages() pdf to pixmap methods

The boolean argument to return pdf pages as pixmaps when getting pages has gone
away and was replaced by new methods:

- box.get_cover_page_pdf_to_pixmap
- box.get_page_by_filename_pdf_to_pixmap()
- box.get_page_by_index_pdf_to_pixmap()
- box.get_pages_pdf_to_pixmap()

## Comicbox Schema

The largest changes are to the internal Comicbox metadata schema that comicbox
returns with box.get_metadata(). It is more hierarchical and what used to be
lists are now often dicts with potentially empty values that when Metron data is
parsed could have identifiers in them.

(The Comicbox 2.0 JSON Schema is
available)[https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/tree/main/comicbox/schemas/v2.0/].
