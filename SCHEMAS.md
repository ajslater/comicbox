# ðŸ“‹ <a href="schemas">Schemas</a>

Comicbox supports reading and writing several comic book metadata schemas.

### Filename Schema

Comicbox includes a pretty good comic archive filename parser. It can extract a
number of common fields from comic archive filenames.

The filename parser is available as a separate library:
[comicfn2dict](https://github.com/ajslater/comicfn2dict)

| Location      | Name                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Archive       | The archive filename  |
| Import/Export | comicbox-filename.txt |

### ComicInfo Schema v2.1 Draft (Comic Rack)

This schema used by the defunct Comic Rack reader is the de facto standard for
comic book metadata on the internet. The
[Anansi Project](https://anansi-project.github.io/) now maintains the
[ComicInfo Schema](https://anansi-project.github.io/docs/comicinfo/schemas/v2.1)
and has compatibly and conservatively extended it.

#### ComicInfo StoryArcs

Comicbox also supports an unofficial, undocumented Mylar extension to
ComicInfo.xml that encodes multiple Story Arcs and Story Arc Numbers as CSV
values.

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicinfo.xml |
| Import/Export | comicinfo.xml |

### MetronInfo Schema v1.0

The
[MetronInfo Schema](https://metron-project.github.io/docs/category/metroninfo)
is a new XML schema for comic book metadata, which hopes to improve some of the
deficiencies that exist with the ComicInfo.xml schema.

| Location      | Name           |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Archive       | metroninfo.xml |
| Import/Export | metroninfo.xml |

#### Metron MangaVolume

The MangaVolume tag is interpreted not as an arbitrary string, but as a range of
integers delineated by a "-". e.g "1-3".

### ComicBookInfo Schema v1.0 (Comic Book Lover)

The schema used by the defunct
[Comic Book Lover](https://bitcartel.neocities.org/comicbooklover/) app. It
supports a few useful tags that ComicInfo.xml does not, but it probably only
survives because Comictagger supports writing it.

I have interpreted the
[ComicBookInfo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/comicbookinfo/wikis/Example.wiki)
example json into a
[ComicBookInfo JSON Schema](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/schemas/comic-book-info-v1.0.schema.json).

| Location      | Name                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Archive       | Zip & Rar Comments   |
| Import/Export | comic-book-info.json |

#### ComicBookInfo Role primary attribute

Comicbox discards the <Role primary/> attribute.

### PDF XMP Schema

The PDF metadata standard. Written directly to the pdf itself or exported as an
xml file.

[Adobe PDF Namespace](https://developer.adobe.com/xmp/docs/XMPNamespaces/pdf/)
[Adobe PDF Standard](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/standards/pdfstandards/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf)
Â§ 14.3.3 Document Information Dictionary

PDF metadata is only read or written from and to PDF files.

| Location      | Name             |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Archive       | PDF internal     |
| Import/Export | pdf-metadata.xml |

#### Reading Embedded Metadata from `keywords`

Comicbox will read most any metadata standard it supports from the keywords
field. If that fails it will consider the keywords field as a comma delimited
"Tags" field.

#### Writing ComicInfo.xml to `keywords`

By default Comicbox will write ComicInfo XML to the keywords field (e.g.
`-w pdf`)

[Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex) supports this because it uses
Comicbox. Other comic readers do not support PDF embedded ComicInfo.xml, but
since they already have ComicInfo.xml parsers it's possible that they might
someday.

If Comicbox JSON is included in the write formats (e.g. `-w pdf,json`) Comicbox
will write comicbox.json to the keywords field instead. It is unlikely that any
other comic reader other than Codex will ever support this.

### CoMet Schema v1.1 (Comic Viewer)

An old and extremely rare comic metadata standard from the defunct
[Comic Viewer](https://www.denvog.com/wordpress/app/comic-viewer/) comic book
reader.

I have interpreted the
[CoMet Specification](http://www.denvog.com/comet/comet-specification/) into a
[CoMet XSD](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/schemas/CoMet-v1.1.xsd).

| Location      | Name      |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Archive       | comet.xml |
| Import/Export | comet.xml |

### ComicTagger Schema

The most useful general comic book metadata writer is
[ComicTagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger). It supports the
ComicVine API, is extensible to other APIs, and features a nice desktop GUI.
Internally, Comictagger keeps a metadata object to work with the schemas it
supports. This schema allows the import and export of that schema.

[Comictaggger genericmetadata.py](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/blob/develop/comicapi/genericmetadata.py)

This schema is possibly only useful to developers using the API to import and
export python dicts, but the capability to import an export this format json
format as json exists. The author of ComicTagger offers no promises as to the
stability of this API and I am very lazy, so the chances of this drifting out of
date are anyone's guess. It was included because it was easy to do.

| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Archive       | comictagger.json |
| Import/Export | comictagger.json |

### Comicbox 2.0 Schema

The comicbox internal data structure which acts as a superset of the above
schemas to allow interpolating.

[Comicbox 2.0 JSON Schema](https://github.com/ajslater/comicbox/blob/main/schemas/v2.0/comicbox-v2.0.schema.json)

#### Comicbox JSON Format

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicbox.json |
| Import/Export | comicbox.json |

#### Comicbox YAML Format

YAML is a superset of JSON, so the JSON schema applies here.

| Location      | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Archive       | comicbox.yaml |
| Import/Export | comicbox.yaml |

#### Comicbox CLI Format

The Comicbox CLI uses "flow style" YAML, which is an all on one line format to
enter metadata on the command line.

Specifying metadata on the command line like this is additive.

| Location      | Name              |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Comicbox CLI  | -m --metadata     |
| Archive       | comicbox-cli.yaml |
| Import/Export | comicbox-cli.yaml |
